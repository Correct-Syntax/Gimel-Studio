Welcome to Gimel Studio's documentation!
========================================

Gimel Studio is a Non-Destructive, Node-Based Graphics Editing Software with realtime composite rendering. 

Edit graphics in a non-destructive workflow using different nodes and view the rendered image in realtime. Edit image textures and convert to maps for use in 3D using special nodes from the node registry. Using the Gimel Studio API you can also script your own custom nodes in Python.
