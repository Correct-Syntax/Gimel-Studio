Gimel Studio Usage
==================

This part of the documentation shows basic usage of Gimel Studio.


Gimel Studio Panels
-------------------

Gimel Studio's UI is made up of rearrangable and resizeable panels.


Image Viewport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel is where the rendered composite image will be shown. It will be auto-updated each time a change is made to the node graph, if you have the *Auto Render* setting checkbox ticked (Default).


Node Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Node Registry Panel lists the registered Gimel Studio nodes available for usage in the Node Graph (both the core nodes and any registered custom nodes will be shown)
