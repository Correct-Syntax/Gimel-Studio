Gimel Studio Usage
==================

This part of the documentation shows basic usage of Gimel Studio.


Gimel Studio Panels
-------------------

Gimel Studio's UI is made up of rearrangable and resizeable panels.


Image Viewport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel is where the rendered composite image will be shown. It will be auto-updated each time a change is made to the node graph, if you have the *Auto Render* setting checkbox ticked (Default).


Node Graph
^^^^^^^^^^

The Node Graph panel

Node Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Node Registry Panel lists the registered Gimel Studio nodes available for usage in the Node Graph (both the core nodes and any registered custom nodes will be shown) 

All of the available nodes are listed in the Node Registry, including any custom nodes. Select an item in the list in the Node Registry to make it active. CTRL+LMB the Node Graph to add the active item node to the Node Graph at the location of the mouse pointer.
