Gimel Studio Official Roadmap
=============================

Possible features/fixes and ideas about how to possibly implement them.

If you would like to help develop Gimel Studio, you can work on any of these or present your own ideas of how to implement/fix these. Other feature ideas are welcome too. :)


PLANNED FEATURES/FIXES, beta versions
-------------------------------------

* INCLUDE ATTRIBUTION/LICENSES OF MODULES IN THE RELEASES (about dialog) [Medium priority]

* Output node to have Export option in Property Panel

* Print image (export to PDF, etc.) [Low priority]
* Project templates (ready-made node setups for cropping an image, converting an image to PBR maps, etc) [Medium priority]

* Support for other languages (will need help from others) [Low priority]

* Nodes
  * Add Text node - adds text to a given image

* Bugs (need to be fixed)
  * You must specify an extension in order to export an image??
  * "to normal map" node - resize auto if image is bigger than req size (otherwise there is a memory issue)

* File opening and saving (including error handling)
  * Error handing for node versions, support, etc.
  * Support opening old/new files with new/old software versions?

* Renderer and Nodes
  * Only re-render nodes that have values changed (cache nodes themselves)?
  * Threading/multiprocessing

* Custom widgets/better layout for node property panel [Low priority]

* Python console in application for developing custom node? (This would help users to be able to debug their code) [Medium priority]

* Nodes
  * 3D Wireframe/Image node - Renders a 3D wireframe image from a .obj file
