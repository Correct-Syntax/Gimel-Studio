Gimel Studio Official Roadmap
=============================

Possible features/fixes and ideas about how to possibly implement them.

If you would like to help develop Gimel Studio, you can work on any of these or present your own ideas of how to implement/fix these. Other feature ideas are welcome too. :)


PLANNED FEATURES/FIXES, beta versions
-------------------------------------


Minimum to release v1.0.0 stable
--------------------------------

[High priority]
[] - Reimplement file open/save from v0.4.2
[] - Renderer and Nodes stable
[] - BUG: You must specify an extension in order to export an image
[] - BUG: "to normal map" node - resize auto if image is bigger than req size
[] - BUGS: Renderer threading, crashes


[Medium priority]
[] - About dialog fixes, licenses 
[] - Node Manager
[] - Only re-render nodes that have values changed (cache nodes themselves)?
[] - 16 bit PNG support, OpenImageIO integration, etc. (transition away from Pillow or a multi-engine renderer)?


[Low priority]
[] - Output node to have Export option in Property Panel
[] - Project templates (ready-made node setups for cropping an image, converting an image to PBR maps, etc)
[] - Keyboard shortcut + menu item for toggling Property Panel

[RANDOM STUFF TO WORK ON]:
* References to "plug" need to be changed to "socket" [Low priority]

* Nodes
  * Add Text node - adds text to a given image

* File opening and saving (including error handling)
  * Error handing for node versions, support, etc.
  * Support opening old/new files with new/old software versions?


POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES/FIXES, version 1.x.x stable
----------------------------------------------------

* Nodes
  * 3D Wireframe/Image node - Renders a 3D wireframe image from a .obj file
  * HDR creation support (node)

* Asset Library?

* Custom widgets/better layout for node property panel [Low priority]

* Python console in application for developing custom node? (This would help users to be able to debug their code) [Medium priority]

* Print image (export to PDF, etc.) [Low priority]

* Support for other languages (will need help from others) [Low priority]

* Popup image preview window dialog when node is double-clicked, with "before and after" feature [Medium priority]
